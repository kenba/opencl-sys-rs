//!
//! `OpenCL` C FFI bindings for the Rust programming language.
//!
//! # Description
//!
//! Rust [FFI](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/ffi.html) Bindings to the Khronos
//! [OpenCL C language headers](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenCL-Headers),
//! see the [OpenCL Resource Guide](https://www.khronos.org/opencl/resources).
//!
//! The API for `OpenCL` versions and extensions are controlled by Rust features such as
//! "`CL_VERSION_2_0`" and "`cl_khr_gl_sharing`".  
//! The default features are "`CL_VERSION_1_1`" and "`CL_VERSION_1_2`".
//!
//! Rust deprecation warnings are given for `OpenCL` API functions that are
//! deprecated by an enabled `OpenCL` version e.g., `clCreateCommandQueue` is
//! deprecated whenever "`CL_VERSION_2_0`" is enabled.
//!
//! The Rust FFI files attempt to match the format and layout of the original
//! C source files instead of [bindgen](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-bindgen/)
//! output files to ease maintenance.
//!
//! The library is declared [no_std](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/intro/no-std.html).
//!
//! ## Use
//!
//! `OpenCL` requires that an appropriate `OpenCL` hardware driver(s) and an `OpenCL` Installable Client Driver (ICD) are installed.  
//! `OpenCL` GPU hardware driver(s) are installed with graphics drivers by the main manufacturers: Nvidia, AMD and Intel.  
//! However, an `OpenCL` ICD must usually be installed manually by:
//!
//! - a Linux package manager, e.g., `sudo apt-get install intel-opencl-icd`
//! - or a Windows download and install from
//! <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/intel-cpu-runtime-for-opencl-applications-with-sycl-support.html>
//!
//! Note: you do *not* need to install an `OpenCL` ICD from the same manufacturer as your hardware.  
//! In general the more up to date the `OpenCL` ICD, the better.
//!
